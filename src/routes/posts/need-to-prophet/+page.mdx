I sometimes get the feeling that life is made of recurring concepts. It's an ambigious but intuitive hunch that history probably does repeat itself quite often. And when it does repeat, our collective memory of what we had learned last time would be weak. The reason that I am bringing this up is because we have already internalized the dangers of a [[adjective]] orator. The cult of personality around "leaders" like Nixon, Pol Pot, and Charles Mason were driven by the fact that they seemed different than us in one special way - they were uniquely charismatic. Charisma is a great tool of power because it not only subjugates but also inspires. I think one of the key learnings from the experiment of Capitalism was the repression is strategically much worse than reclaiming and repurposing. The classic Zizek example was of commodifying dissent - turning protests against capitalism into goods you can manufacture and sell under capitalism. I think charisma carries a lot of the same structural elements. The folks who are lured in by people with high charisma not only having a fondness of the person, but have a fondness of the idea of charisma itself. There are no possible internal conflicts that can act as safeguards to the lure of a charismatic leader.

I have a feeling that this recursive effect of charisma has been amplified by social media - the edits, one-liners, catch phrases, and parasocial relationships. 

Charisma isn't all bad. There are charismatic people worth looking up to. But the fact is that charisma will always be a tool for rose tinted glasses.
