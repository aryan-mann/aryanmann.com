This post is about how I made the website that you are currently reading. You can find the source code in this [Github repository](https://github.com/aryan-mann/aryanmann.com). There are a couple of nice features that I would like to highlight, primarily:

1. Support for MDX (Markdown with JSX) files
2. Statically generated and hosted on Vercel/Netlify/Cloudflare Pages/etc.
3. Blogging system with tag-based filtering
4. All this using Vite and Svelte!

<br>

With this setup, it's much easier to focus on writing because how it works is:

1. I want to write about X
2. I create a file called `X.mdx`
3. Add some metadata at the very top of the file like this:

```mdx
---
title: X
date: 2022-09-09
tags:
  - tag1
  - tag2
---
```

4. Start writing!

<br />

Once I am done, all I have to do is a simple series of `git add --all`, `git commit -m "new post"`, and `git push`.
