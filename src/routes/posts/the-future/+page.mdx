Something feels different. The past few years have flown by. I've had fun roaming around, meeting friends and family, checking off a lot of firsts. First job. First rented house. First couch. First lay off. First motorbike. First brother to get married. First loss. I've known that all these firsts are a right of passage into adulthood and community. I could ask older folks for advice and usually, even if it's not good advice, there would be advice. [..connect..]

As a kid, I despised being a kid. On one family beach vacation when I was eight, I slung around a huge film camera that my dad loved to carry around. I took pictures of the landscape, placing the subject on one of the grid lines instead of the center in accordance with the rule of thirds. I adjusted the shutter speed and aperture and took the perfect landscape picture. Some faraway mountain with some kind of water below. Wow. I did so because I wanted to be like him, a grown up with hobbies. Hobbies that I pick myself. I dreaded going home and back into the place I hated the most - the prison. Surprisingly some kids enjoyed the prison and called it by a cute nickname "School." Even as a kid, I dreamt of the day I would finally leave the prison and grow into an adult. I wanted to choose what I study, where to go, what to eat for lunch. Adulthood to me meant freedom.

I was fourteen when I released my first game. Just a year before the release, I torrented and printed out the book "C++: The Programming Language" by Bjarne Stroustrup and brought it to school everyday. In the downtime between school periods and lunch break, I took out one chapter, loosely held together by paperclips and read through the contents. With no access to a computer in school, I read it like a novel, trying to visualize the control flow and syntax. I distinctly remember one memory from that time. During a "free period," one of the teachers who taught Computer Science to 11th grade students was called in as the substitute teacher to look over the class. She was making the rounds and came to my desk, looked at me with my stack of loose papers, and told me that I wouldn't learn anything this way. She carried on with her rounds. I went home and attempted to make a height converter with what I had learnt.

As an adult, I sometimes wish for childhood. To have the freedom of the Aryan that emailed a reporter and got featured in a blog post online. The Aryan that pedalled so fast that he beat someone three years older in a bicycle race; then proceeded to slide on the concrete pavement and lost a good chunk of skin. However, the more I reflect, the more I believe that adulthood and childhoods as concepts are deceptive and bordering on meaningless. [..something about looping effects..?](#link-to-ian-hacking). Now that leaves me reconsidering my firsts. What exactly about my first couch moved me towards adulthood and why does it suddenly feel that all adults have disappeared?

It seems clear to me that adulthood and virtue as synonymous, although with differing historical baggage. For the rest of this, let's consider this to be true. I think it's important to point this out because we often conflate age, structures, existing institutions, etc. with virtue just because of this conflation.
